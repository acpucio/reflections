When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe if you're moving around. Or just to have a place where you can store your work remotely or non-locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If your git branch is being shared, you may not care for 
	what other users are putting in.  Manuual pulls allow for 
	more judicious pulls.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With this copy of last known state of the remote, you can see

    the remote don't get clobbered from local or changes from local
    don't clobber remote.
