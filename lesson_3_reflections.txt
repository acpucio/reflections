When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe if you're moving around. Or just to have a place where you can store your work remotely or non-locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If your git branch is being shared, you may not care for 
	what other users are putting in.  Manuual pulls allow for 
	more judicious pulls.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a deviation from the master, a clone is a copy of the master tree, a branch is like a fork.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With this copy of last known state of the remote, you can see
    if the remote had changed.  You need to know this so changes from
    the remote don't get clobbered from local or changes from local
    don't clobber remote.    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I've never collaborated before on the scale that was required for Git or GitHub.
    I guess I would have to go the old route of using CVS, or just 
    exchanging source code via email or usb or ftp access.    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you were wanting to try major revisions locally, you would want to
    make changes in a seperate branch rather than directly on master.  Also
    master may be production code.  You don't want to break master.

    But it's easier to push and pull directly on master for sure, but there's 
    risk involved.
