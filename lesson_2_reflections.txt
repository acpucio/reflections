How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    staging area is functionally between the working directory and the repository.  It allows a user to reconsider adding stuff to the repository?


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	This is a place to check.  A pause to look at what you're committing before
  	a change happens


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	It's good when you want to try something that you're not sure will work
 	but you want to keep track of working or legitimate code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Personally, the diagrams abstract out alot of the worded noise.
	The shapes are easier to grasps, along with picking out relationships 
	between the shapes.
